## Rock Paper Scissors Why Should You Play? 

Many people are often in the dark as to what the Rock Paper Scissors game offers its players. This is because they are ignorant of what the game is truly about and what comes with playing the game. Participants who have understood the concept of the game will agree that the game is a really interesting game that offers a lot of excitement. As a participant, you can play the game on a professional level or to catch fun. Either way, the game is opened to everyone. Learning how to play is not as hard as it looks, as long as you have the intention to learn and practice.

The truth is that you will find out that the game can be personalized. For instance, consider the individual benefits available in the process of learning and practicing, the skills and experience to be gained, and, most importantly, the level of professionalism to be attained. Additionally, the game can be played to drive a personal interest or purpose (for fun), which is one way the game offers flexibility.

## The Mind And Physical Exercise 
One beautiful thing about the Rock Paper Scissors game is that you can improve your wellbeing and lifestyle by merely playing the game, either informally or on a professional level. The game requires physical exertions such as extending hand gestures and standing (with little body movements) for a couple of minutes. Not only that, the mind is not left out in the equation. The game involves that you are mentally active. Some of the mental exertions include mind reading, strategic planning, and mind control.

All these combined will not only aid your performance but will also improve your personal life. Physical exercise will keep you physically fit and improve your muscles. Mental preparation helps you with focus, consciousness, concentration, and control of your mind. All these are the benefits you get to enjoy playing the Rock Paper Scissors game.

## Design (Pre Development)

## Technologies Used
### Resources

- Gitpod
- Visual Studio Code (VSC)
- GitHub 
- Heroku
### Libraries
#### color 
- colorama==0.4.6
- colored==2.2.4
- termcolor==2.5.0
[random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) - to generate contrast colors in the python terminal

## Next Improvement Backlog
- Using the game to decide between participants for a specific task. For instance, used between siblings to decide who clears the table or trims the garden. Colleagues can also play the game to decide who pays the bill for lunch.

- Add an option for two players to play against each other, taking turns to input
their choices. The program should then determine the winner based on their
inputs. 
- Creating a multiplayer RPS game to involve more than the regular numbers of participants

Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **May 14, 2024**

## Reminders

- Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
- Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
- Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

Happy coding!
